                <h2>Segregation</h2>
                <p>The intention of this approach is to build separate roadways for each color. This means that for each color, there exists its on motorway movement.
                    The key reason for this approach is that the flow of traffic is consistent. Specifically, each of the colored houses move in the same directions to the same stores
                    without having to worry about traffic jams or abrupt stops in its path. This strategy is generally easy to maintain in the initial phases, but as the game progresses
                    you will notice it becomes very difficult to maintain this segregation. However, you must keep in mind that this idea can be very costly to the amount of available roadway tiles
                    you may have so ration them accordingly.

                <h2>Road Matte Blocking</h2>
                <p>In each round, the general location of houses and stores are randomly placed on the grid. This can become very stressful in each run as there exists uncertainty between
                    your laid out plans and the games intentions. However, you may notice that these placements only occur on grids
                    with open space. This approach reduces the uncertainty at the cost of utilizing the extra road mattes you may have. With this approach you can scatter any extra 
                    mattes of roads upon the grid in areas that you wish a store or home should not appear. This forces the game to generate these buildings somewhere else which can give you
                    a more predicatable outcome in the game. Placing these mattes in specific corners or regions of the field that you want to be left open can save you from an unfortunate placement 
                    from the game.

                <h2>Grouping Similarities</h2>
                <p>
                    Similar to Segregation, this form of approach can be a flexible strategy for the end game. Instead of segregating by colors, we can make roadways for similar pathed houses to stores.
                    If a set of houses with differing colors appear to need to travel the same path to their respective stores, it can be best to utilize this approach to bring them all to their stores
                    while greatly reducing the amount of road tiles used and will be less worries about traffic or slow movement.
